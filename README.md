## üìñ Description

We systematically study four crucial elements of applying the Diffusion Model to Few-shot
Semantic Segmentation. For each of these aspects, we propose several reasonable solutions
and validate them through comprehensive experiments.

Building upon our observations, we establish the DiffewS framework, which maximally
retains the generative framework and effectively utilizes the pre-training prior. Notably, we
introduce the first diffusion-based model dedicated to Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,
setting the groundwork for a diffusion-based generalist segmentation model.
